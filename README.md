# Doctor-Patient-Portal-Management-System
The Doctor-Patient Portal Management System is a web-based application developed using Java, Servlets, JSP, and JDBC to streamline the interaction between doctors and patients. The system aims to provide a user-friendly platform where patients can book appointments, view prescriptions, and communicate with doctors, while doctors can manage patient records, schedules, and medical histories efficiently.

The backend is powered by MySQL for database management, with JDBC used for database connectivity. Tomcat serves as the web server to host the application. The project ensures a secure and responsive design, providing an easy-to-navigate interface for both doctors and patients.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: JSP for dynamic web pages.
Backend: Java Servlets for handling business logic.
Database: MySQL for storing user data, appointments, and records.
Server: Apache Tomcat for deploying and running the application.
Libraries: MySQL Connector/JAR for database connectivity.
